# PSU_malloc
Epitech school project for which we had to implement tiny clones of malloc &amp; friends
<br><br>
- Implemented functions : malloc, free, calloc, realloc

- Constraints : mandatory use of brk/sbrk to obtain memory, respect of Epitech's coding norm (arf ^^)

Since the grading criterias were not about speed optimizations, this repository actually contains two working versions of the project : the one I turned in, and a buddy allocator I made as a bonus.
The former obtained a better score when tested by the autograder, but the latter is *much* faster.
